This is just a reference codebase for different sorting algortithms and their implementation in c++.
Many of these are readily available on blogs like [GeeksforGeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org), [Tutorialspoint](https://www.tutorialspoint.com) and [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia), with much better explanation.

- Some rather special algorithms like Tournament Sort, aren't yet available online.

So i decided to help other students by providing a well formatted implementation of the algrithms in C++.

Hope this would Help you in any way.
